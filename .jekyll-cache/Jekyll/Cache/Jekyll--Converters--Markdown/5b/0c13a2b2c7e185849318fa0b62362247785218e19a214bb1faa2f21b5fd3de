	<p>My name is Youssef Abdelhady. I am a Junior at Marist College. A couple of my hobbies include playing video games, such as Madden and Call of Duty. I also like going to the gym, and also watching TV or movies. I choose Computer Science as my degree, out of pure boredom, previous to choosing this major, I never coded or even looked into Computer Science. My first major was Criminal Justice ðŸ˜‚. My friend told me about this major and I haven't looked back since. </p>
